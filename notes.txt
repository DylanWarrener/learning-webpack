When updating css-loader to 4.0+, vue-style-loader no longer loads scoped style tags in vue files. (disabled noImplicitAny in tsconfig)

// Scoped
With scoped, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components. However, a child component's root node will be affected 
by both the parent's scoped CSS and the child's scoped CSS. This is by design so that the parent can style the child root element for layout purposes.
Therefore, scoped parent spills into direct children, so children can use it. But, using scoped in child removes the parents css.
